## Dashboard Tabs

### 📊 Track Current Release Cycles
- Select any release (3.4, 3.5, etc.)
- View all 3 events: EA1, EA2, GA
- See metrics: feature count, story points, capacity status
- Review complete feature lists with JIRA links

### 📝 Draft Release Plans
- AI-recommended 2-year plan (3.5-3.12)
- Release goals for each cycle
- Capacity-constrained distribution
- Feature names, sizes, and summaries for each event

### 🔬 Feature Analysis
- **Phasing Analysis:** Which features can be split across DP/TP/GA
- **Sizing Distribution:** Breakdown by feature size with recommendations
- **Optimization Recommendations:** Specific suggestions for splitting large features
- **Optimized Draft Plans:** 2-year plan with recommended optimizations applied

## Capacity Guidelines

- 🟢 **Conservative** (≤30 pts) - Low risk
- 🟡 **Typical** (30-50 pts) - Normal capacity
- 🟠 **Aggressive** (50-80 pts) - High load, needs mitigations
- 🔴 **Over Capacity** (>80 pts) - Extremely risky

## Auto-Scheduling Algorithm

The auto-scheduler distributes features across releases based on:

1. **JIRA Plan ranking** (if available)
2. **Target end dates** (earlier dates first)
3. **Story points** for capacity management
4. **Hard capacity limit:** 80 pts/event maximum

Features are automatically sized if story points are missing:
- **XL (13 pts):** Infrastructure, migration, architecture
- **L (8 pts):** Implement, develop, create, build
- **M (5 pts):** Update, enhance, improve (default)
- **S (3 pts):** Fix, adjust, minor, docs

## Automatic Updates

The dashboard updates automatically via GitHub Actions:
- **Weekly:** Every Monday at 8:00 AM UTC
- **On code changes:** When `release_manager.py` or `auto_scheduler.py` are updated

### Manual Update

Trigger a manual update:
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select "Update Release Plan" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**
4. Wait ~2 minutes for completion

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do some features show "NOT IN PLAN"?**
A: They exist in JIRA project RHAISTRAT but aren't in the Advanced Roadmaps plan. They're ranked lower in auto-scheduling.

**Q: Can I edit the plan in the dashboard?**
A: The dashboard is read-only. To modify feature scheduling, update JIRA and regenerate the dashboard.

**Q: How often should I regenerate?**
A: Weekly auto-updates are sufficient. Trigger manually if you've made major JIRA changes.

**Q: Why are releases showing 78-80 pts per event?**
A: The auto-scheduler respects the 80 pt/event capacity limit. Features that don't fit remain unscheduled.
