## Understanding the Data

### Feature Sizing

Features are auto-sized if missing story points:
- **13 pts (XL):** Infrastructure, migration, architecture
- **8 pts (L):** Implement, develop, create, build
- **5 pts (M):** Update, enhance, improve (default)
- **3 pts (S):** Fix, adjust, minor, docs

### Scheduling Priority

Features are scheduled based on:
1. JIRA Plan ranking (if available)
2. Target end date (earlier dates first)
3. Default priority ranking

### Capacity Planning

- **Target:** 50 pts/event (typical capacity)
- **Hard limit:** 80 pts/event (aggressive max)
- Features that don't fit by RHOAI 3.12 remain unscheduled
- Based on historical data: 27.5 pts/event median

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do some features show "NOT IN PLAN"?**
A: They exist in JIRA project RHAISTRAT but aren't in the Advanced Roadmaps plan. They're ranked lower in auto-scheduling.

**Q: Can I edit the plan in the dashboard?**
A: The dashboard is read-only and displays AI-recommended plans based on JIRA data. To modify feature scheduling, update JIRA and regenerate the dashboard.

**Q: How often should I regenerate?**
A: Weekly auto-updates are usually sufficient. Run manually if you've made major JIRA changes and need to see them immediately.

**Q: What's the difference between Fix Version and Target Version?**
A:
- **Fix Version:** Committed and approved for delivery
- **Target Version:** Intended but not yet committed
- Fix Version takes priority in the dashboard

**Q: Why are all releases showing 78-80 pts?**
A: The auto-scheduler respects the 80 pt/event limit. This is by design - features that don't fit remain unscheduled for future planning.
